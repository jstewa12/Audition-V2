//Main chunk of code for game
//Changes to be made:
//add changes to judges faces when you get an answer wrong
//add changes to screen to show loss of points and/or flash red/green when right or wrong
//add start screen and start button and restart button and instructions
//possibly add distractions
//make ai more presentable
//experiment to give players more time (probably different reduction equation)
//
//bugs:
//skips round 9
//location of text is wak
//html thingy is stupid
//maybe: unsure if answers are correctly being chosen
//weird warnings in the console I don't care much about
//first round is occasionally weird with text

"Yeah, it can be frustrating.  Everyone hopes to make it big and I’m no exception.  Man what I would do for that…",
"I jump right into the role.  Researching takes time, and that time is better spent with practice in my opinion.  I may not be able to perfect the role, but I’m a bit quicker when we get started without preparation.",
"Foreign accents are something that come naturally to me.  I can speak in an Australian accent quite easily, but I’ve never tried to imitate anything else.",
"I get along very well with the community.  I very rarely make friends with other people who like acting, but I can work with them in a professional setting.",
